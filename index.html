		Link elements tell the browser that it needs to download another file. 
		The rel attribute specifies the kind of relationship between the current file and the linked file. 
		In this case it's the main icon symbolising the page. 
		It's often called the favicon (short for Favourites Icon)- since in the early days of the web it's main use was as the icon used in favourites menus. 
		In modern browsers it also appears in the tab next to the title, as well as in users browser history and any anywhere else where something would need an icon to represent the page. 
		The href attribute gives a "relative address" for it (meaning an address that is based on the address that this file is at, so it doesn't need to include all the folders above. 
		Files in the same folder are simply the filename and extension, to start the filepath from two folders above where this file is start with ../../ and to start at the "root" start with /

				<p>A 2D top down indy game about escaping an Asylum.</p>
				<p>
					The game will be built and released incrementally over at least the remainder of 2021.</br>We released the first beta with just the opening scenes in June 2021. Through July we improved it massively. Since then we've been expanding the game, and occasionally doing little tweaks and improvements based on feedback.
				</p>
				<p>We'll add sections to the game, plus new game mechanics and smarter, better equipped guards over time. By the end of 2021 there should be a pretty good game out of this - an indy game for sure, with creative game mechanics, tricky puzzles, some tense action and an interesting story based on player choice. </p>
				<p>Oh and we're now adding cheat codes and level codes. Try guessing some now - you might be able to get into our alpha testing area!</p>
			</div>
			<div id="roadmapTab" class="hidden homePageTabs">
				<p> Opening beta is launched, and has had some improvements. Now in our "secret" alpha test area theres some of the next bit of the game, which will include some player choices. <br/>
				Also it sets the story well and there's a bit where you can control movement but calling it a "level" might be a stretch.</p>
				<p>Here's a very rough road map for the early months of development. Some things will overlap with previous activities</p>
				<ol class="alignLeft">
					<li><b>Concept and requirements (DONE)</b> - this was where I thought through the basics of what this game would be and how I'd do it</li>
					<li><b>Basic project setup (DONE)</b> - staging area connected up to a github repo for the project, simple landing page built, concise description of what the game will be </li>
					<li><b>Basic movement (DONE)</b></li>
					<li><b>Main character design (DONE)</b> - It's very cartoony but I'm happy with it now</li>
					<li><b>Opening story screens (DONE)</b> - the next stage of the game, that is currently in Alpha gets a bit more into meat of the story</li>
					<li><b>Simple first level with no guards </b> (<i>Beta ++ quality</i>) - it's interesting from a story perspective, whilst allowing you to get a feel for the controls and has had some improvements made based on a small sample of feedback, though there's a few finishing touches I'd like to add at some point.</li>
					<li><b>"2nd level"/branching choices</b> currently being worked on in Alpha. This part of the plan has changed a bit based on an emerging strength of this game.</li>
					<li><b>More levels</b> with increasingly better AI and more game mechanics - releasing gradually over the remainder of 2021</li>
					
					<!-- List Item templates:
					<li><b>Step</b>(<i>Not started</i> - detail)</li>

			<div id="techInfoTab" class="hidden homePageTabs">
				<p>
				Currently built entirely in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. (We may add in some JS or CSS frameworks later, but for now it's all pure JS)<br/> 
				The game runs entirely in the players browser - which means it's not reliant on a good internet connection.
				</p>
				<p>
				We're making our game engine from the ground up - which means it will take some time to do, but also gives us some benefits:
				</p>
				<ul class="alignLeft">
					<li>We have complete control over it - so if we want or do something very innovative or a bit out there, we can</li>
					<li>It will be easy for our community to use the game engine, or bits of it, for other projects - we can even use levels of SRA to test out game mechanics that could become the core of other games</li>
					<li>We can make sure that the game engine is easy to understand and work with</li>
					<li>Experience: working on a game engine is a great way for developers who haven't built many games before, to really understand how games work under the hood</li>
					<li>Every developer who joins up with, or collaborates with ProtoStart will be able to talk to the developers who built the game engine</li>

			</div>
			<div id="mullingTab" class="hidden homePageTabs">
				<p><b>Here's a little glimpse into my creative thought process:</b>
				</p><p>
				The first level could have an intro like <del>"We smuggled in a controller for a robot for you to aid your escape. It should be hard to detect, try moving it!"</del> -   <b>Much better idea:</b> you're incapacitated in the asylum, dosed up on happy pills, reliant on a (hoverwheelchair?? hoverchair?) -- hoverchair for movement. Maybe on the first level your character just wants snacks.
				<br/>this gives a nice reason for some levels to have turn based blocky movement and others to have a more natural movement style when our prisoner is actually fleeing the asylum, and maybe we could have a hard to control vehicle for levels with continuos unstoppable movement.
				</p>
				<p>
				Being dosed up on happy pills for the first few levels would be pretty cool - maybe I could make a really surreal background. It fits the first bit of my opening story draft. Having the first few levels just being life in the Asylum would also help build the narrative quite well - you're not immediatly escaping. The player gets to experience their character being in a potentially rather bleak location for a while, maybe building connections to other characters there - could we make players care about what happens to those characters??
