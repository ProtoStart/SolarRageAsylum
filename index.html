	<!-- head tag houses: 
	a) "metadata" such as what character encoding standard this file uses
	b) Stuff used outside of the main browser pain (eg the tab bar, favourites, search engines)
	c) links to other files that are needed as well (such as .css stylesheets and .js JavaScript files

        <meta charset="utf-8">
		<!-- <title> appears in search engine results as the pages title, is shown in the browser tab on most browsers (or as the title bar in browsers without tabs) and is usually what browsers list the page as in history and bookmarks. Generally you always want to have a title tag. For games it makes sense to match up with the game name, or maybe sometimes have it say the level or area name -->

		Link elements tell the browser that it needs to download another file. 
		The rel attribute specifies the kind of relationship between the current file and the linked file. 
		In this case it's the main icon symbolising the page. 
		It's often called the favicon (short for Favourites Icon)- since in the early days of the web it's main use was as the icon used in favourites menus. 
		In modern browsers it also appears in the tab next to the title, as well as in users browser history and any anywhere else where something would need an icon to represent the page. 
		The href attribute gives a "relative address" for it (meaning an address that is based on the address that this file is at, so it doesn't need to include all the folders above. 
		Files in the same folder are simply the filename and extension, to start the filepath from two folders above where this file is start with ../../ and to start at the "root" start with /

		<link rel="stylesheet" href="mainStyles.css"> </link>

		<!-- script tags are for JavaScript - you technically can directly put JavaScript code into these tags, but usually it's easier for devs to work with a seperate file. Notice that the attribute on script tags to state a filepath is src not href (this catches out the best of us sometimes!) -->
		<script src="SRAHomePage.js"></script><!-- TODO: really I should update the JS filename (or rename it like mainUpdate001) for each update as an easy way to make sure that returning visitors use the correct js rather than probably using a cached version -->

				<p>A 2D top down indy game about escaping an Asylum.</p>
				<p>
					The game will be built and released incrementally over at least the remainder of 2021.</br>The first level will just have basic movement and very very simple to build stuff and is due out in June 2021. Once that is available we'll work on level 2. In level 2 you'll have to avoid guards, but they'll be a bit stupid and lazy - it makes it easy enough for level 2 of a game, and also means we can release level 2 without having made effective AI. 
				</p>
				<p>We'll add levels with new game mechanics and smarter, better equipped guards over time. By the end of 2021 there should be a pretty good game out of this - an indy game for sure, with creative game mechanics, tricky puzzles, some tense action and hopefuly an interesting story. 
				</p>
				<p>Oh and we'll have cheat codes and level codes, because I like old school stuff like that (and besides level codes are a quick and easy thing to get working, and don't require storing data)</p>
