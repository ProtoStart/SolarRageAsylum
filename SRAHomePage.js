		Currently, it is only for unlocking things that are hidden within the page already - it isn't intended to be secure, and everything can run on the client side.
		Main planned use: allowing access to stuff that isn't polished enough for feedback, but won't matter if curious people find it.
		Also: Easter eggs, cheat codes, level codes
	
		This needs to:
			get the contents of the input with id codeUnlock (DONE)
			test it against various secret codes (DONE for now, TODO: for long term should use a switch or a dictionary of keys - so it just looks up the value in a list and pulls off the correct option, rather than have a big string of ifs that will get ugly and hard to use) 
			do a particular thing if it matches a code (for certain things DONE)
			give a big "nope" if it's incorrect (DONE)
