/**This file should only have stuff used actually used in the beta for key things.

NOT IN HERE:
Specific level stuff  --- ahahahaha - there's currently loads in here for the opening section and first level, and its probably all "technical debt" that I'll have to sort out before I've got multiple levels!
smaller additions to gameplay mechanics
stuff just for the landing page
stuff being experimented on in Alpha

We expect this file to get cached in players and developers browsers and not have to be reloaded too often.

It is in use from the first beta release onwards

STUFF THAT SHOULD BE IN HERE:
Basic movement and collision detection
Generic functions for showing and hiding content apropriately
Controlling what part of the game the player is in
Main game menu

/*Global Variables
	Anything defined outside of a function is in "global scope", which means any function can access it.
	I quite like having all my globals in a single JSON var. I've used the name globals here so that it's clear whenever you see it used that it's one of the globals you are using (in other projects I often go with "data" which is shorter though not as obviously a global var).
	You can access the individual parts of JSON variables like this: 
		globals.bounds.top
	There are other ways too - search for "JSON traversal" or "read JSON"
