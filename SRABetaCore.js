/**This file should only have stuff used actually used in the beta for key things.

NOT IN HERE:
Specific level stuff
smaller additions to gameplay mechanics
stuff just for the landing page
stuff being experimented on in Alpha

We expect this file to get cached in players and developers browsers and not have to be reloaded too often.

It is in use from the first beta release onwards

STUFF THAT SHOULD BE IN HERE:
Basic movement and collision detection
Generic functions for showing and hiding content apropriately
Controlling what part of the game the player is in
Main game menu

/*Global Variables
	Anything defined outside of a function is in "global scope", which means any function can access it.
	I quite like having all my globals in a single JSON var. I've used the name globals here so that it's clear whenever you see it used that it's one of the globals you are using (in other projects I often go with "data" which is shorter though not as obviously a global var).
	You can access the individual parts of JSON variables like this: 
		globals.bounds.top
	There are other ways too - search for "JSON traversal" or "read JSON"

			also the black area needs to be smaller
		For Beta 0.0.1 "Early taster Beta" this was done with:
			a copy of the game area markup within the screens div,

		For an improved opening sequence: 
			I want the game area to stay on screen
				An easy way to do that is a seperate div that we just also show in this function
			I want the rainbowVortex to move on it's own at the start
				and then it'll stop during the story
				- to have done this on the stand in one, 
					I would've had to add quite a chunk of stuff that I'd done for the proper game area
		SO NOW:
			this function brings up the next div of words,
			but also the actual game area 
				- without the buttons 
					(those are set to hidden, and altered when we want players to be able to move the character)
				without keyboard input just yet 
					(they have to only be enabled at movable parts anyway - otherwise that would clash with typing into inputs)
				without the extra border we have for preventing the vortex going over the main page background
