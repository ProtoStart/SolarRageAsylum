/*Global Variables
	Anything defined outside of a function is in "global scope", which means any function can access it.
	I quite like having all my globals in a single JSON var. I've used the name globals here so that it's clear whenever you see it used that it's one of the globals you are using (in other projects I often go with "data" which is shorter though not as obviously a global var).
	You can access the individual parts of JSON variables like this: 
		globals.bounds.top
	There are other ways too - search for "JSON traversal" or "read JSON"
