		Link elements tell the browser that it needs to download another file. 
		The rel attribute specifies the kind of relationship between the current file and the linked file. 
		In this case it's the main icon symbolising the page. 
		It's often called the favicon (short for Favourites Icon)- since in the early days of the web it's main use was as the icon used in favourites menus. 
		In modern browsers it also appears in the tab next to the title, as well as in users browser history and any anywhere else where something would need an icon to represent the page. 
		The href attribute gives a "relative address" for it (meaning an address that is based on the address that this file is at, so it doesn't need to include all the folders above. 
		Files in the same folder are simply the filename and extension, to start the filepath from two folders above where this file is start with ../../ and to start at the "root" start with / 
		-->
		<link rel="icon" href="favicon.png" type="image/x-icon"></link>
		<!-- Another link element - in this case a stylesheet (literally a file that defines how things look).  -->
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="generalStyles.css"> </link>
		<!-- Stylesheet specificly for gameplay -->
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="gameStylesTest.css"> </link>
		<!-- script tags are for JavaScript - you technically can directly put JavaScript code into these tags, but usually it's easier for devs to work with a seperate file. Notice that the attribute on script tags to state a filepath is src not href (this catches out the best of us sometimes!) -->
