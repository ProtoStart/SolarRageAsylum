	<!-- head tag houses: 
	a) "metadata" such as what character encoding standard this file uses
	b) Stuff used outside of the main browser pain (eg the tab bar, favourites, search engines)
	c) links to other files that are needed as well (such as .css stylesheets and .js JavaScript files
	
	Basically everything that isn't in the main pane of the browser

		<!-- meta tags state some kind of "Metadata". In this case the "charset" which is short for "character set" which is also known as the files "character encoding". Don't change or remove this line unless you know what you're doing.-->
        <meta charset="utf-8">
		<!-- <title> appears in search engine results as the pages title, is shown in the browser tab on most browsers (or as the title bar in browsers without tabs) and is usually what browsers list the page as in history and bookmarks. Generally you always want to have a title tag. For games it makes sense to match up with the game name, or maybe sometimes have it say the level or area name -->
        <title>Solar Rage Asylum</title>

		Link elements tell the browser that it needs to download another file. 
		The rel attribute specifies the kind of relationship between the current file and the linked file. 
		In this case it's the main icon symbolising the page. 
		It's often called the favicon (short for Favourites Icon)- since in the early days of the web it's main use was as the icon used in favourites menus. 
		In modern browsers it also appears in the tab next to the title, as well as in users browser history and any anywhere else where something would need an icon to represent the page. 
		The href attribute gives a "relative address" for it (meaning an address that is based on the address that this file is at, so it doesn't need to include all the folders above. 
		Files in the same folder are simply the filename and extension, to start the filepath from two folders above where this file is start with ../../ and to start at the "root" start with /

		<!-- Another link element - in this case a stylesheet (literally a file that defines how things look).  -->
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="generalStyles.css"> </link>
		<!-- Stylesheet specificly for gameplay -->
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="gameStyles.css"> </link>
		<!-- script tags are for JavaScript - you technically can directly put JavaScript code into these tags, but usually it's easier for devs to work with a seperate file. Notice that the attribute on script tags to state a filepath is src not href (this catches out the best of us sometimes!) -->
		<script src="SRATestAreaV0-0-3a.js"></script><!-- we should update the JS filename for each update as an easy way to make sure that returning visitors use the correct js rather than probably using a cached version -->

			<p>Welcome to our <i>real</i> testing area<br/> Stuff here will change without warning whenever a developer wants to test something, or even work on something pretty much live to the web. If they've not explained here, asking in our reddit forum is currently the best way to find out what's going on. This "ramble" will be changed by devs every now and then to fit what's going on</p>
			<p>Currently working on basic movement through on screen buttons. The buttons aren't styled yet, or even properly positioned - that will come soon. The buttons work, though without collision detection - so the yo can go out of the play area. Next, if I have time later today (or if not then Fri 4th June), I'll do some work on preventing it going out of the box. It's likely that in future I'll change how much the character moves for each button press, and for live action rather than "turn based" I'd really want the movement to repeat while the button is held down or for pacman / snake style movement keep going until change of direction or collision. I'm thinking SRA will have a mix, with first level being turn based and grid based. First level could have a intro like "We smuggled in a controller for a robot for you to aid your escape. It should be hard to detect, try moving it!" - this gives a nice reason for some levels to have turn based blocky movement, then we have a more natural movement style when our prisoner is actually fleeing the asylum, and maybe we could have a hard to control vehicle for continuos movement.
</p><p>
			Later on this page where we'll test out more movement stuff, new character graphics, level designs and more. Watch out for updates from PGDesign on reddit, and refresh the page ocassionaly during the 3rd of June, to watch it improve - and come back in a week or so to see bigger jumps of improvement. We will also use that code thing for level codes, extra stuff for the curious, and cheats. Because some old school gaming things are just cool.</p>
