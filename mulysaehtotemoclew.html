	<!-- Solar Rage Asylum, alpha testing page - a web based game where the devs will show you their process for making it, and make the source code easy to read and understand! -->
	<!-- This tag, with !-- is a comment - browsers and search engines ignore it, but human developers can read it to get more info. This project intentionally has more of them, than you might normally find, so that it's super easy for beginners to understand everything -->
	<!-- head tag houses: 
	a) "metadata" such as what character encoding standard this file uses
	b) Stuff used outside of the main browser pain (eg the tab bar, favourites, search engines)
	c) links to other files that are needed as well (such as .css stylesheets and .js JavaScript files
	
	Basically everything that isn't in the main pane of the browser

		<!-- meta tags state some kind of "Metadata". In this case the "charset" which is short for "character set" which is also known as the files "character encoding". Don't change or remove this line unless you know what you're doing.-->
        <meta charset="utf-8">
		<!-- Tag below appears in search engine results as the pages title, is shown in the browser tab on most browsers (or as the title bar in browsers without tabs) and is usually what browsers list the page as in history and bookmarks. Generally you always want to have a title tag. For games it makes sense to match up with the game name, or maybe sometimes have it say the level or area name -->
        <title>Solar Rage Asylum</title>
		<!-- Prevent search engines showing this hidden page - note if a search engine has already included the page before this was added, it will only take effect when they next "crawl" the page - you can request Google recrawl using there URL inspection tool others might have something similar-->
		<meta name="robots" content="noindex">
		<!-- 
		Link elements tell the browser that it needs to download another file. 
		The rel attribute specifies the kind of relationship between the current file and the linked file. 
		In this case it's the main icon symbolising the page. 
		It's often called the favicon (short for Favourites Icon)- since in the early days of the web it's main use was as the icon used in favourites menus. 
		In modern browsers it also appears in the tab next to the title, as well as in users browser history and any anywhere else where something would need an icon to represent the page. 
		The href attribute gives a "relative address" for it (meaning an address that is based on the address that this file is at, so it doesn't need to include all the folders above. 
		Files in the same folder are simply the filename and extension, to start the filepath from two folders above where this file is start with ../../ and to start at the "root" start with / 
		-->
		<link rel="icon" href="Icons/icon.png" type="image/x-icon"></link>
		<!-- Another link element - in this case a stylesheet (literally a file that defines how things look).  -->
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="generalStyles.css"> </link>
		<!-- Stylesheet specificly for gameplay -->
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="gameStyles.css"> </link>
		<!-- script tags are for JavaScript - you technically can directly put JavaScript code into these tags, but usually it's easier for devs to work with a seperate file. Notice that the attribute on script tags to state a filepath is src not href (this catches out the best of us sometimes!) -->
		<script src="SRATestAreaV0-0-3a.js"></script><!-- we should update the JS filename for each update as an easy way to make sure that returning visitors use the correct js rather than probably using a cached version -->
		<!-- open source vanilla JS cookie acceptance popup (a cookie popup of some kind is required by EU law if there are any cookies)-->
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="purecookie.css"/>
		<script src="purecookie.js"></script>

			<p>Welcome to our <i>real</i> testing area<br/> Stuff here will change without warning whenever a developer wants to test something, or even work on something pretty much live to the web. If they've not explained here, asking in our reddit forum is currently the best way to find out what's going on. This "ramble" will be changed by devs every now and then to fit what's going on</p>

				<b>Working on a beta page today</b> It will go live in the next couple of days<br/>
				<b>Last update here:</b>Morning 14th June 2021 (UK time)<br/>
				<b>Added/improved:</b> Since the update from the 10th I've improved some stuff in the "head" section of HTML pages which effects how results in search engines and sharing links show up.</br>
				<b>Why?</b> Sharing links: I shared a link to this page to my dad through a popular messaging service and it put in part of a comment in the source code as the description ... yeah that signals to me, that it's time to make sure I have good meta tags<br/>
				Beta page: Now that I've got some graphics, movement, collision detection, and a draft of a story, it's time to form this into a proper beta release <br/>
				<!--<b>Do I expect to finish it this session?</b> I'm just having a quick go at it, if I'm not making progress within 25 min I'll move onto some other part of SRA<br/>-->
				<!---->
				<b>What other areas of SRA will get some dev time in the next week?</b> I'm working on the first level beta release. I'll need to finish: adding the opening story, forming the stuff below into an easy level of stuff to go around and to get to, adding polish, then getting the word out about this game.
