		Link elements tell the browser that it needs to download another file. 
		The rel attribute specifies the kind of relationship between the current file and the linked file. 
		In this case it's the main icon symbolising the page. 
		It's often called the favicon (short for Favourites Icon)- since in the early days of the web it's main use was as the icon used in favourites menus. 
		In modern browsers it also appears in the tab next to the title, as well as in users browser history and any anywhere else where something would need an icon to represent the page. 
		The href attribute gives a "relative address" for it (meaning an address that is based on the address that this file is at, so it doesn't need to include all the folders above. 
		Files in the same folder are simply the filename and extension, to start the filepath from two folders above where this file is start with ../../ and to start at the "root" start with /

			<p>You can play this entire game using either: touch screens, mouse and keyboard, just keyboard or just a mouse.</p>
			<h3>Touch screens and mouse:</h3>
			<p>tap or click on the buttons shown on screen.<br/>
			If a screen is just story, tapping/clicking on the story does the same as the Next button</p>
			<h3>Keyboard:</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Action sections:</b> w,a,s & d or arrow keys for movement, e or space to rotate. <br/>
				<b>Story sections:</b> 
				
				standard accessibility keys for your web browser can be used to cycle through and select options<br/>
				Typically:<br/>
				Tab cycles through options<br/>
				Shift + Tab cycles through options in reverse<br/>
				Space checks or unchecks checkboxes<br/>
				Enter activates selected buttons.<br/>
				The game automatically sets keyboard focus to the "Next" button <br/>
