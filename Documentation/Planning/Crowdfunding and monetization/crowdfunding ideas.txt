Crowdfunding ideas

	Why?
	-- Crowdfunding could cover essential project costs such as hosting and domain name
	-- It might be able to allow us to afford "nice to have" costs, such as covering the cost of tools and maybe allowing us to make something better than we would otherwise be able to.
	--- If the project can cover living costs for a while the project lead wouldn't need to look for another contract for a while - so would be able to put full working weeks into this rather than basically hobby time.
	
	What is Crowdfunding?
	-- It's a form of project funding, where lots of people offer small amounts of money each to fund a project, usually in return for a copy of the thing being made once it's ready plus some kind of personalisation or limited edition merchandise.
	-- Projects put up a listing on a crowdfunding website and plan for lots of people to want the project and add-ons enough to pre-pay. 

Crowdfunding platforms and their differences
	Kickstarter
	-- This is one that I (PG) am familiar with - I've been a funder and also ran an (unsuccessful) campaign there before.
	
Other forms of funding that exist
	Bank Loans
	
	Grants
	-- Government
	-- Charities / non-profits
	-- I don't really know much about them, presumably you have to fit set criteria
	--- Are grants for games a thing? Maybe the learning aspect might be fit for one?
	
	Creators already having lots of money 
	-- Sadly the main creator on this project is not at all loaded haha, I can cover small amounts if needed, but I can't splurge on this.
