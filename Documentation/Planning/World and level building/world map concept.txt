WORLD MAP CONCEPT   - Work In Progress
- this is written to my intuition, and subject to revision and edits
- I'll add to this as development goes on

Rec = Recovery room (Rec 3 is start), C = Corridor, GPC = Guard Post in Corridor, Mon = Monitoring station, Lck = Locked door, Exit - Exit/entrance to the asylum, Rcp = Reception, Tri = Triage/assessment room, Wa = Waiting area, Wc = WC - toilet facilities, Off = Office, Str = storage room (depending on what it's near stores: medical supplies, hoverbeds or office supplies)
	Grid columns marked with | at the top, and spaced in this regular text file by using 4 spaces or 1 tab - if it looks wonky than either you aren't viewing this in a monospace font (where every character and space has the same width as each other) or you have a tab representing a different size than 4 spaces. 
	Game starts in Rec3 - which is in grid square 10 or row 1 column 0, from there you can move into a corridor in grid square 11 which is row 1 column 1.

	With this as our grid, we can use tens for row and unit for column if using two digits.
	It is quite a small map, but I think I should keep it that way at least until we have a full (ie not "beta" release). Maybe if we get to a point where this game can be really ambitious, this could just be considered the "starter" asylum, or show that this is just one small wing of the asylum - we could add in extra digits or characters to let asylums be bigger. Then row 4 column 3 in the starter asylum could map to A43, while wing 6 column 5 row 7 of the 3rd asylum could be C657
	
	Other potential ways of doing grids considered:
	(awkward) I could do hexadecimal to extend that to 16 each way but that doesn't seem worth the extra complication - I'm not sure JS even really does hex as var type, this is largely as either ints or strings anyway, and lets face it hex would be awkward for human developers to use for grid refs. 
	Grid refs based on letters (eg's: FZ, QE, AB)
	Columns in letters and rows in numbers or vice-versa - eh I'm not feeling it.
	
	
	- While we want some rooms to be the same kind of room, we do still want variety in them - we don't want the place to feel samey
	- A games location must also facilititate the game mechanics that the game promises.
		- In SRA's case this means we need some rooms with areas of natural light where solar rage could happen
	- a games location should fit any promises that a new player is hoping for from the game name or description. In this case, obviously the majority of the world has to be an asylum.
