BETA NOTES (keep this professional-ish!)
Known imperfections:
Needs quite a bit of styling work for smaller screens
	Everything gets shrunk down to try to fit in, but then it's too small to see detail or tap buttons
		plus since some stuff is fixed to the top, and some stuff is fixed to the bottom, theres then a gulf between sometimes, and if you zoom in to see one thing, you can't see the other - a nightmare for the playable section!


Kludgey workaround in place currently, for the rainbow vortex being able to go beyond the game area and looking silly
	Potential solutions: (I'll start with trying the simpler solutions and playtest until I find one that works well)
	a) First kludge tried: a large black border - V Simple good for first level, probs won't last for others. This gives an area around the game area that would still show the rainbow effect, but with existing code would prevent you from moving the character into that area
		- Makes the visible game area larger than I wanted 
			it's way too big for mobile 
				(it might shrink everything down to fit the window but even that is a problem),
			on my laptop screen I feel I need the window maximized
				theres only a few pixels gap
				now there isn't even a nice visually clear border to help with this
	a2) Current kludge in place - slight variation on solution a that I tried - not quite as large border and smaller rainbow vortex
		- I dont't like having a smaller rainbow vortex
		- It's still going to be too big for mobile
		- I still have to position the game area quite carefully, just not as much
			- so I still miss having the contrasting border
		- I'm going to check this in (commit it to github) but only for the benefit of saving this for prosperity and it's been a while since I made a commit.
			- I'll even stick comments by the changed values so that I can easily undo them without reverting the commit
				- if I committed and rolled back I think I'd lose record of it, but at minimum I'd roll back all of the other beta stuff and have to patch it up!!
			
	b) could enlarge the div, but not fully match the bounds to it 
		- would presumably have the same effect as a border for the first level
		- except I could have the old thin line of lime as a border again 
			which would be nice for making sure that the game area is entirely visible in the browser pane
		- also seems better for the long run, once the rainbow and black background go
			- would keep the game area consistent for the player, which would be good for UX
			- You'd match the background graphic to show the place you're in, 
				and the boundary values would be where walls start in the image
				you could match them up either way, or even a bit of both
					graphic to the boundary
					or boundary to fit the graphic
		- Might require repositioning things, and changing border values
	c) (done a little bit of this) could shrink the bounds values
		- that might make a very small effective game area
			not an issue for levels where you're confined to a small room
				which makes sense at the start
			In fact after trying a and a2 I quite like the sound of this option
	d) as it gets near to the boundary start clipping the rainbows element on that side? - seems like fairly complex coding compared with the other solutions
	e) is there some CSS or HTML trick I could do to make the rainbow clip when it goes out of the box?
	
RECENT FIXES  AND IMPROVEMENTS!! YAY!!
We're now actually sort of saving the name when we take it yet - it's not used anywhere yet, and it's not permenantly saving it anywhere - it's just stored in a JavaScript variable
The keyboard controls are now only active on the actual playable level - so if you type a name with a,w,s or d or use the arrow keys you can no longer get an alert saying that you've bumped into a wall!!!
Rainbow vortex on screen throughout the story (without the extra border and without controls until you get to that point)
	Now also moves during that time, stops when you get control, and theres a neat handover now where it's like oh the rainbow has stopped spinning lets try moving.
Swapped the alerts that happened when you collided into walls, with text at the top - so much nicer to play
Keyboard controls stated on screen when you can move, next to the buttons (much better UX)

Slightly less reliant on people guessing to click text now, as I've put a hint on screen002. I'll work on full fix for next update.
	Some more work done - automatically moves people from screen001 to screen002 after a few seconds (I've also done some of the coding for the next/back buttons, but they're not quite ready to go in yet thanks to bugs)

Story improvements - it now feels more like you're a crazy person - it's a bit more chilling and captivating
Found and immediatly fixed a bug where if you where fast moving on from the opening screens, the code meant to automatically move on from screen001 to screen002 had the effect of loading screen002 while keeping whatever screen you'd got to up - now it will only auto show screen002 and try to remove screen001 if you are actually still on screen001 at the time
rainbowVortex no longer has a visible lag

Added Previous and Next buttons! They show or are hidden depending on what's apropriate for the screen you are on, but always in the same place. (These where trickier and more long winded to get working than you might expect!)
