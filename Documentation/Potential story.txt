--- Original brainstorming lines for the opening section ---
[used]You awaken in a haze,
[draft]the surroundings,
[draft]they're different,
[draft]and kind of not staying still.
[replacement] or is it still a dream?

[replacement]
Other than yourself, and the hoverbed you're laying on
there is only a great magnificent vortex of light descending from above,
flowing around and under you

[used]
You feel calm.
Very calm.

[Draft]
Maybe too calm, given you can barely see, barely move and what you can see is ... floaty and not anything you remember seeing before.
[Used]
Maybe too calm, given you can barely see, and what you can see is not your normal reality.

[Added during development]
Maybe we should start trying to figure some things out.

What's your name?

[enter name]

[Drafted but later decided the fourth wall breaking element didn't work]
Ahh nice to meet you, I'm Derek your new internal monologue. Or perhaps if this is a game then you could say I'm the narrator for this little story. 
Apologies, I'll try to fix up that fourth wall again. It's not very good nar-ayyy err I mean that's not very helpful for an internal monologue. 
Don't worry, you're not crazy. 
[original draft line, which unfortunately doesn't work with the gameplay very well]Though, judging from the padded empty room we're in, and the fuzzy calm sensation you're currently feeling, um, maybe there's a chance someone else got that impression??
[revision option 1] All the best people have internal monologues that give themselves names 
			like this, and it's <i>hardly rare</i> for a brain as bright as yours to 
			think of existence as being more than it appears
[bridging addition so we can use 1 and 2] Yes that must be it. Oh and the weird vision?? Yeah that's er, that's not normal, though it can happen as a result of various substances being in your system, both prescribed and "recreational". 
[revision option 2] At least, <i>I</i> don't think you're crazy. This hoverbed we're on does seem to be some kind of hospice or er, dare I say it, an asylum bed.
[possibly a mix - try them in situ]

What happened last night? Is there a chance you wheren't your regular self? (Pick the option that seems the most likely for a character you'd want to play)

["I can't quite remember, but knowing me I wasn't .. exactly sober", "All I remember is having a quiet night in alone", "I was out with my mates but staying sober - someones got to keep everyone safe", "Duuuude like that was like yesterday man. I think the cosmos was calling out. Yeah, that's it! The cosmos was calling out to me, inviting me to bask in it's radiance down the beach, so I went down there and just sat looking out onto the waves man!"]


--- Mulling ideas for after player has moved around a bit ---
	- inner monologue goes back to the tone of thinking everything through
		- recaps what is known 
		- starts putting things together
		- move story towards next level - we need the story to give a reason for being able to see again 
	I'll take on the text based adventure idea J suggested, and there's that medical drips suggestion M said - that could be a cool mechanic 

Ok so ... we're in a padded room, that we don't remember going into, on a hoverbed
