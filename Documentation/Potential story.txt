You awaken in a haze,
the surroundings,
they're different,
and kind of not staying still.

You feel calm.
Very calm.

Maybe too calm, given you can barely see, barely move and what you can see is ... floaty and not anything you remember seeing before.

What's your name?

[enter name]

Ahh nice to meet you, I'm Derek your new internal monologue. Or perhaps if this is a game then you could say I'm the narrator for this little story. 
Apologies, I'll try to fix up that fourth wall again. It's not very good nar-ayyy err I mean that's not very helpful for an internal monologue. 
Don't worry, you're not crazy. 
[original draft line, which unfortunately doesn't work with the gameplay very well]Though, judging from the padded empty room we're in, and the fuzzy calm sensation you're currently feeling, um, maybe there's a chance someone else got that impression??
[revision option 1] All the best people have internal monologues that give themselves names 
			like this, and it's <i>hardly rare</i> for a brain as bright as yours to 
			think of existence as being more than it appears
[bridging addition so we can use 1 and 2] Yes that must be it. Oh and the weird vision?? Yeah that's er, that's not normal, though it can happen as a result of various substances being in your system, both prescribed and "recreational". 
[revision option 2] At least, <i>I</i> don't think you're crazy. This hoverbed we're on does seem to be some kind of hospice or er, dare I say it, an asylum bed.
[possibly a mix - try them in situ]

What happened last night? Is there a chance you wheren't your regular self? (Pick the option that seems the most likely for a character you'd want to play)

["I can't quite remember, but knowing me I wasn't .. exactly sober", "All I remember is having a quiet night in alone", "I was out with my mates but staying sober - someones got to keep everyone safe", "Duuuude like that was like yesterday man. I think the cosmos was calling out. Yeah, that's it! The cosmos was calling out to me, inviting me to bask in it's radiance down the beach, so I went down there and just sat looking out onto the waves man!"]
