Friends "M" and "J" played the SRA Beta - version 0.0.7 - here's some notes from that
They really liked the dialogue - apparently it reminded M of Douglas Adams - that's quite a compliment from M



Friends suggestions:

	J suggested:
	I could double down on the narrative sections, making the game a text adventure with movement/action sections sprinkled in for variety.
		- This sounds pretty cool, and would probably be an easier game to program than what I had in my mind.
		- The writing would need to be consistantly good, but that actually seems to be a strength of this game, as well as something I'm enjoying
		- That would mean player choices would effect narrative - at least what order they do things
		- I had been thinking this would be "on rails" and all about the action - the narration was mostly to set the scene and add drama to the action, but this seems cool. I'm going to take on this suggestion, at least try it out. 
		- Maybe if it feels like more effort than it's worth, or if I find it really hard to do well, then I might not take it to Beta, or I might just have a tiny bit of this style here and there
		
	M suggested:
	Hover effects on the hoverbed
		eg: light radiating from underneath
			the light takes time to dissapear, so you leave a trail behind you as you move
			- This would look really cool
			- I think I'll save working on that for during the Kickstarter though
				- seems like the kind of extra flourish that fits into polishing up the game, rather than the kind of thing that needs to exist for the trial to even work
				- I could even have Kickstarter stretch goals for being able to customize the glow in settings
	Discovering that you've got medical drips attached to your veins
		- the container bags are attached to the bed - you don't have to wheel them separately or drag them along
		- from my memory of what M said, I picture three different drips and maybe you don't know what they are at first, and have to figure them out.
			- Three might be a bit much for a few reasons: 
				screen area for mobile players - IDK, maybe if the bars are short it could work - it would probably challenge my design skills anyway
				Narratively - at least to fit in with what's known so far
				Initial difficulty
		- These could then be shown in a HUD (Head Up Display) 
			- I guess you'd need 
		- Oooh maybe the asylum could have a bunch of different drips to find with different effects, and maybe they each have 
		
At least one friend didn't pick up on that are now fixed:
	that they could use their keyboard to get through story screens - I've since put a controls screen in to state all the control options available
	where the link on the home page was for actually playing the Beta - I reworded the link to make it clear
