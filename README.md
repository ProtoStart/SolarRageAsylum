# SolarRageAsylum
JavaScript arcade style game - Can you escape the Asylum?

Initial reddit post about this project:
https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtoStart/comments/n36s4n/perfect_for_beginners_lets_build_a_simple_web/


Summary:
- A technologically simple web based game, with 2D graphics and (initially at least) single player arcadey gameplay, and a bit of story between levels.
- Story isn't fixed from the start of development, but generally about escaping an Asylum. I'm not expecting a complex storyline with an immersive world, but a bit of a story to add intrigue and so you care about the main character a bit would be cool.
- Game mechanics and levels will be added over time by the community (including the project owner)
- Anyone can join the development team, and this project was chosen to be easy for rookies to get into (plus a limited amount of mentoring is available!)
- Project owner is Phil Ganney (PhilGanney on github, PGDesign on reddit)
- Languages - HTML, CSS & JavaScript - maybe some common JS libraries such as JQuery if they seem to be incredibly useful for some aspect. (Intention is to keep the tech stack similar to regular web coding to keep skills gained transferable between ProtoStart projects).

The game name conjures up an image of an arcade style game in my mind, perhaps a bit like pac-man, where in some levels you're avoiding being caught by guards and maybe also having to manage how long the character is in a sunlight provoked rage. In other levels you would have to avoid being seen by the guards at all, and as the game progresses, maybe they'd get better at detecting you, and your rage would make it harder to stay unnoticed and less easy to control.

Web address will initially be protostarter.com/SolarRageAsylum
I'm also considering doing a crowdfunding campaign to cover 
1) getting a domain specifically for it
2) more time for me to work on this (ie take it beyond a community hobby project for me)

Big thanks to fantasynamegenerators.com - I used their video game name generator to inspire a name. I didn't directly take the name verbatim from them, but "Solar Asylum" for a simple web based game, was enough to make me think up quite a bit of the vision for this.
