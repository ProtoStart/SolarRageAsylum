/* Basic cell colour coding by labels. These styling rules are written as classes within specific classes to allow us to just change the class of the grid element to swap between colour code systems. The user chooses colour coding scheme via a select that swaps a class on the grid. Cells are given classes in the grid creation function, regardless of what kind of colour coding is in use, and those classes only need change when the data they are based on changes. */

/*cell colour coding by design completeness, initially just set by the designer in a dropdown, later we might add the feature that the value changes to started when any value has been changed, and described when there are more than a set number of words in the description or maybe when they save a change to the description it prompts. Would be really awesome if it could go as far as being realted to roll out too, but I think that's beyond my skill at the moment. Starting this with a grey scale for default to described and then maybe traffic light and gold for cellComplete?*/
