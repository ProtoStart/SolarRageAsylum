						This part is being built. For the designers benefit here's the Solaris Asylum Description as some sample text:
						"Possible names: Solaris Asylum. The Rage Asylum - Solaris. The Solar Rage Asylum. Solaris.\n\nThis Asylum is the main starting asylum, that will be most early players first experience of Solar Rage Asylum. It will need to bring the player into the general concept of the game, and have a feeling that fulfils the promises given by the game title \"solar rage asylum\". The other big goal is to interest people into making their own Asylums.\n\nPromises given by the title \"solar rage asylum\":\n - \"solar raging\" - it needs areas where natural light can get in at set times of day, to trigger off the rages. That also needs to pair up with useful times as well as challenging times - it's a double edge sword mechanic, and also part of what game designers call \"systemic design\" where there's  an environment and surrounding that players can use to their advantage.\n - \"solar\" hints towards sci-fi, \"asylum\" hints towards a dystopia. It should feel sci-fi! It should feel dystopian!! The game has hoverbeds as a clearly sci-fi marker, what other sci-fi things might work well in an Asylum, and feel dystopian? Data-pads of some kind, electronic doors that go upwards or maybe downwards, CCTV and monitoring, maybe some kind of HAL/\"friend computer\", rockets where a car park would be!! Ridiculous shifts for the people working at the Asylum?\n\nWhat might interest someone to build their own Asylum?"

					<div id="boundsInfo" class="hidden roomEditorPanel">
						<p>Bounds are the boundaries of the grid cell when shown in game. Every grid cell must have a top, right, bottom and left boundary even if the room continues to another gridcell. Currently the game doesn't allow for any more bounds - each cell is a rectangle, with no gaps - you can add extra walls as objects, but they do not count as a grid cells bounds and should not be stored in the bounds section of the Asylum JSON.</p>
						<p>For each of a rooms bounds, we store at least: 
						<ul>
							<li>
							'val': short for value, the number of pixels from the left or top that the boundary is on, within the gameplay area of the screen.
							</li>
							<li>
							'known': wether the location of the boundary is known to the player character. In other words should it be shown on screen if the character cannot see. Generally this should kept as 'no' in this asylum builder tool, and the game will change it to 'yes' when the player discovers it. If this doesn't make sense, you need to play the starter Asylum!
							</li>
							<li>
							'type': is it a wall, a wall with a doorway or where a corridor continues to another gridcell 
							</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>Different types of boundary need different additional info stored. If it's a wall with a doorway we need to know where the doorway is, if its locked and which grid ref the door leads to (the games inner logic can't yet figure this out, and maybe - this being a game about escaping an Asylum - the doorways don't always need to make sense. Or perhaps you don't want a 2d square asylum, and want to do something nifty if confusing to design like set aside some cells as secret cellars, or have secret staircases from one end of the asylum to another)
						</p>
						<p>Rooms can be different sizes, though there is a maximum size they can be before we would get issues when playing on small screens, and a minimum size to actually allow for the Player Character to physically fit</p>

						<p>I might rename this section "items & NPCs" or have two seperate sections. Does the tool need to use the same name as the file system? or maybe the filesystem should be renamed. Bump Coords are what SRA calls hitboxes.  The game needs to store for each room, what are the things inside, where are they, are they moving, what happens if the player character collides with them, can the player interact with them</p>
						<p>This part of the UI will be a bit more complex than the bounds and designers description sections. Originally I was planning on having a seperate tool for creating new items and NPCs, but perhaps it makes more sense to have that all in here. Items are probably best designed in situ with their first use, and would you really want these on different tabs??</p>

					<p>We may need an entire view for adding items to the game, and another version of it for addings NPCs</p>
