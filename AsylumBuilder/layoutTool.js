Since the filter list has all of the keys in there, it doesn't filter out anything, but since it places things in the order in which they are matched in the filter array, and our filter array is sorted, it has the effect of sorting each level of our object. This does mean that every key is ordered alphabetically within it's parent, but that consistency could make it easier for others to understand. This solution does mean we use the same full list of every key in the object for each nested part of the object, but the performance seems to be okay, so I'm not concerned about that.

				Key part here:
				Fast cloning with data loss - JSON.parse/stringify

By default, movement adheres to the grid as you'd expect - eg, going through top bounds will take you to the cell above unless that would take you out of the grid. Having these in the data rather than calculated in the game engine, allows us to override it at design time if we wish and also means these calculations are only done during Asylum design - good for performance.
